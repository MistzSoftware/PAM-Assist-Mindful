#### 1.3.3 Resources

- Single Developer
- Student Budget (Limited)
- Open-Source Technologies (Tools, Libraries, Frameworks)
- Estimate time based on 2 afternoons dedicated to the project per week (3 hours each): **468 hours** (78 weeks x 2 days/weeks x 3 hours/day = 468 hours)
  - **V1: 180 hours** (30 weeks x 2 days/weeks x 3 hours/day = 180 hours)
  - **V2: 276 hours** (46 weeks x 2 days/weeks x 3 hours/day = 276 hours)
  - **Vacation: 12 hours** (2 weeks x 2 days/weeks x 3 hours/day = 12 hours)
