# PAM Assist Mindful

PAM is envisioned as a robotic assistant for the elderly, designed to assist them in various aspects of their daily lives.

While there are existing solutions, such as "Veiller sur mes parents" by La Poste, these services are often limited and do not provide comprehensive, round-the-clock support for seniors.

PAM will have the capability to:

- Remind individuals to take their medication, specifying which pills to take, with an integrated pillbox.
- Provide written transcriptions of oral conversations to aid those with significant hearing loss, enabling them to follow conversations without the need for raised voices.
- Respond to its name, navigate available spaces without colliding with furniture, people, or pets, and move seamlessly across different types of flooring such as parquet, tile, and carpet. It will also be capable of overcoming certain obstacles like puddles or door thresholds.
- Call for help or contact a loved one using voice commands, dialing emergency numbers or pre-registered contacts as needed.

The final product should be approximately 1.5 meters tall, but the prototype will be around 50 centimeters in height, significantly reducing costs.

Many future improvements can be incorporated, such as automatic medication management or AI assistance for individuals with Alzheimer's (Enzo's moonshot) integrated into PAM.
